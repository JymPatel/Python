# Kinda important notice

This program will not work 100% of the time, why? 
Becuase someone could have renamed or disabled the default local Raspberry Pi Hostname that this program needs to work or disabling pings.
Due to the possibility of someone doing this i wouldn't rely **too** much on this program.

# How do I run it?

Running it is kinda simple. All you have to do is:
1. Make sure you have Python 3 enabled
2. Make sure you can use the os module
3. Make sure your computer is connected to the network you want to scan
4. Make sure your computer can send ping requests
5. Run the program
6. Get results!
