# Contributing Rules
Before contributing make sure to make your own fork.
Rule 1: Make sure your code is in its own folder. (eg: /Python3-FirstEditon/PyPrograms/ _put your program's folder here_ )  
Rule 2: There are **NO** spaces allowed in **ANY** filename or folder name. (Basically don't do this with your filenames: what the dog doin.py)  
Rule 3: Make sure you add a readme.md file describing your code.  
Rule 4: Remember: If your code uses modules then make sure to create a file called requirments.txt in the same folder of your code with the names of all the modules you used.  
Rule 5: Always have at least some comments in your code.  
Rule 6: Test your code before making a pull request from your fork to this repo.  
Rule 7: This rule is very important as it has to relate to licencing and stuff. The rule is you are **REQUIRED** to have a GPL V3 disclamer in some form in every file you make except for the requirments.txt file if you have one. If you cant or wont use GPL V3 then your code will not be allowed to be put here due to licencing.  
Rule 8: Don't steal code and say that its your own. You can take small bits of code** from sources like stackoverflow and stuff but don't take entire programs** from people without asking thier permission **AND** giving credit to the original person who made it.  
Rule 9: Remember the human.  
~~Rule 10: Do the mario~~  
Rule 10: Whenever you make changes make sure to also write down the changes you made somewhere due to licencing.  
** If you copy some code and the original owner allows you put it in here but it does not already have a GPL V3 Disclamer in it then add one WITH the original creator's consent.
