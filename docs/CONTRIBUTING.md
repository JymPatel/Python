# Contributing Rules
Before contributing make sure to make your own fork (or branch) so you can test in your own sandbox.  
**YOUR CODE STYLE** (@bupboi1337 rename to better name)  
Rule 1: Make sure **ALL** your code is in its *own folder*. (eg: /Python3-FirstEditon/PyPrograms/ _put your program's folder here_ )  
Rule 2: There are ***NO** spaces allowed in **ANY** filename or folder name*. (Basically don't do this with your filenames: what the dog doin.py but instead do this: what-the-dog-doin.py or this: whatthedogdoin.py)  
Rule 3: Make sure you add a [readme.md](../readme.md) file describing your code.  
Rule 4: Remember: any modules you import must be listed in a file called requirments.txt.  
**SECURITY OF CODE**  
Rule 5: Dont upload malicious code, just dont.  
Rule 6: Test your code before making a pull request from your fork/branch to this repo.  
Rule 7: This rule is very important as it has to relate to licencing and stuff. The rule is you have to have a GPL V3 disclamer somewhere in your code but do **NOT** put one in a requirments.txt file. Also adding more is reccomended so people know. If you cant or wont use [GPL V3 License](../LICENSE) then your code will not be allowed to be put here due to licencing.  
Rule 8: Don't steal code and say that its your own. You can take small bits of code** from sources like stackoverflow and stuff but don't take entire programs** from people without asking thier permission **AND** giving credit to the original person who made it.  
Rule 9: Remember the human.  
**ALSO MAKE SURE THAT**  
Rule 10: Whenever you make changes, do **NOT** directly commit to main unless its something realllllly small but instead make a pull request (eg: a grammer change can be directly commited while adding a new program cannot).  
Rule 11: Make sure the files you make/upload have a extension unless you are 100% unable to do so (.py for python files, .md for text files, and .txt only for requirments.txt files. Basically have each file have thier respective extension.)  
Rule 12: Whenever you change something, write what you added, changed, or deleted in the changelogs in the main readme file.  
** *If you copy some code and the original owner allows you put it in here but it does not already have a GPL V3 Disclamer in it then add one WITH the original creator's consent.*
