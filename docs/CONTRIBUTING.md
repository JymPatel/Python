# Contributing Rules
We are very happy to see you contributing in our repository but please make sure to follow rules to make sure it's easy to browse and contribute in code by others.  
Before contributing make sure to make your own fork (or branch) so you can test in your own sandbox.  
  
##### **WHAT YOUR CODE SHOULD LOOK LIKE**  
Rule *1*: Make sure **ALL** your code is in its *own folder*. (eg: /Python3-FirstEditon/PyPrograms/ _put your program's folder here_ )  
Rule *2*: There are ***NO** spaces allowed in **ANY** filename or folder name*. (Basically don't do this with your filenames: what the dog doin.py but instead do this: what-the-dog-doin.py or this: whatthedogdoin.py)  
Rule *3*: Remember: any modules you import must be listed in a file called requirements.txt.  
  
##### **SECURITY OF CODE**  
Rule *4*: Dont upload malicious code, just dont.  
Rule *5*: Test your code before making a pull request from your fork/branch to this repo.  
Rule *6*: This rule is very important as it has to relate to licencing and stuff. The rule is you have to have a GPL V3 disclaimer somewhere in your code but do **NOT** put one in a requirements.txt file. Also adding more is recommended so people know. If you can't or won't use [**GPL V3 License**](../LICENSE) then your code will not be allowed to be put here due to licencing.  
Rule *7*: Don't steal code and say that its your own. You can take small bits of code** from sources like stackoverflow and stuff but don't take entire programs** from people without asking their permission **AND** giving credit to the original person who made it.  
** *If you copy some code and the original owner allows you put it in here but it does not already have a GPL V3 Disclaimer in it then add one WITH the original creator's consent.*  
  
##### **ALSO MAKE SURE THAT**  
Rule *8*: Whenever you make changes, don't directly commit to main unless its something really small. if its not small then make a pull request (eg: a grammar change can be directly committed while adding a new program cannot).  
Rule *9*: Make sure the files you make/upload have a extension unless you are 100% unable to do so (.py for python files, .md and .txt for text files, and .txt for requirements.txt files. Basically have each file have their respective extension.)  
Rule *10*: Whenever you change something, write what you added, changed, or deleted in the changelogs in the main readme file.    
By doing all of these you can keep this repo tidy and nice.
